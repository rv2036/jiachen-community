## Open Source Internship Joint Recruitment and Training

**Open Source Internship Joint Recruitment and Training** was issued by Mr. Wei Wu, the director of the Jiachen Project, to the members of the Jiachen Project, the motive and starting point are "members use minimal financial and management resources to achieve the accelerated development of RISC-V ecosystem goals that are beneficial to their own companies", drawing on the Jiachen Project director’s 10 years of experience in large-scale intern training, and leveraging the work accumulated by the PLCT Lab in the open-source community, starting from the Year of the Dragon in the Jiachen cycle, more than 2,000 internship positions will be made available each year, with over 1,000 students recruited to participate in internships.

Please refer to the [Open Source Intern Joint Recruitment and Training Project initiated by the Jiachen Project director (in Chinese)](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/TenVAVzaWuUWGIWodGaFKA) for more detailed information.

## RISC-V Builder Mutual Recognition Network

Establishing the **RISC-V Builder Mutual Recognition Network** is one of the three main goals of the Jiachen Project. Unlike common certification systems, the RISC-V Builder Mutual Recognition Network is a fully trust-based network personally endorsed by the Jiachen Project director. Its purpose is to build a RISC-V talent identification system that connects over 10,000 professionals in RISC-V chip design, software development, community operations, and education and training, enabling mutual recognition and collaboration in the RISC-V talent field. Endorsement No. 000 was issued by the Jiachen Project director to his own as "root trust certificate" for formal purposes only, ensuring convenience for future processing by computer programs.

The detailed issuance information of the RISC-V Builder Mutual Recognition Network is stored in the ["jiachen-builders-network" GitHub repository](https://github.com/rv2036/jiachen-builders-network).

## RISC-V Dev Board Wandering Project

**RISC-V Dev Board Wandering Project** is open to all developers and enthusiasts who wish to donate their unused RISC-V development boards, as well as those who would like to receive a RISC-V development board. Participants hold dual roles in this activity: while donating a board, they can also receive a board donated by someone else.

The Wandering Project operates with a point system. Donors earn points equivalent to the purchase price of the board upon completion of the donation. Participants with sufficient points can receive RISC-V development boards donated by others for free. Each new participant automatically receives a certain amount of initial points. Jiachen Project member companies can donate development boards to the Wandering Project and designate the corresponding points to individuals the company believes have contributed to the RISC-V ecosystem.

The point system is maintained by a volunteer team designated by the Jiachen Project director in a community-driven form. The physical storage method of the boards, device inspections, and management of shipping information are handled by organizers (Wandering Bases). The Wandering Base is responsible for receiving donations, inspecting and refurbishing devices, and shipping them to the next applicant. In addition to storing wandering devices, the base also covers the shipping costs for receiving and sending the devices.

Mr. Wei Wu, the Jiachen Project director, is the initiator of this activity. Each organizer (Wandering Base) can also recruit a long-term volunteer to manage the project as the Wandering Base leader (manager).

For more detailed information, please visit the ["riscv-board-wandering" Github repository](https://github.com/rv2036/riscv-board-wandering), where the activity guidelines can be found in the “wandering-guidelines.cn.md” file.

## Offensive Paper Reading SIG (OPR SIG)

With the rapid promotion and application of RISC-V chips across various industries globally, issues related to chip microarchitecture and software security have also started attracting attention from the industry.

Unlike traditional large enterprises that heavily invest in security teams, the RISC-V ecosystem consists of many small and medium-sized enterprises. While they have a strong demand for security awareness, maintenance, detection, and prevention, they are also sensitive to the costs of security investments and have a natural need for collaborative security services. On the other hand, the RISC-V architecture has become the platform of choice for many computer technology enthusiasts and students majoring in information security.

The vision of the Jiachen Project is to extend RISC-V to cover all information industry scenarios, and security assurance has been part of the long-term roadmap from the very beginning.

Mr. Wei Wu, the director of the Jiachen Project, has invited Mr. Li Weiwei to serve as the group leader and lead reader of the "Jiachen Project · Offensive Paper Reading SIG (OPR)". The OPR group will soon begin a series of security paper readings and offensive verification work, with the verification process shared with related member enterprises of the Jiachen Project.

Kubuds Technology plays a key role in convening and connecting the information security aspects of the Jiachen Project. Mr. Li Weiwei, co-founder and CEO of Kubuds Technology, has a solid background in information security defense, combining hardware and software from his studies at the University of Science and Technology of China and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. After founding Kubuds Technology, he has continued to provide services such as CVE security updates for legacy systems.

## Open Source Contribution Recognition and Coordination Sponsorship Nomination Committee

In order to promote the security and reliability of open-source software projects across multiple dimensions, to give more recognition to open-source contributors, and to address the following core issues: How to determine if an open-source project is "important and in need of support"; how to identify developers in need of sponsorship; how to decide on the sponsorship amount, duration, and post-sponsorship evaluation criteria; and how to avoid bias, decision-making errors, and corruption allegations in the sponsorship process.

Mr. Wei Wu, the director of the Jiachen Project, has begun forming a new Open Source Contribution Recognition and Coordination Sponsorship Nomination Committee.

Vision: To ensure that every open-source software contributor receives reputation and financial rewards commensurate with the social value they generate.

Mission: To provide and maintain a series of passive observation systems that offer sponsors specific suggestions for sponsorship targets and plans, while ensuring no new administrative or mental burdens are placed on open-source developers.

Goal: By 2036, to provide funding distribution recommendations for over 1,000 core contributors to key global RISC-V open-source software projects, with over US$100 million in support.

## RISC-V Software Porting and Optimization Championship (RVSPOC)

In order to accelerate the development of the RISC-V software ecosystem and attract more developers to join the RISC-V ecosystem, the RISC-V Software Porting and Optimization Championship (RVSPOC) has been launched. The RVSPOC focuses on the desktop and server software ecosystem and presents a series of public challenges in areas such as compilers, runtime environments, and AI software stacks. Developers from around the world are invited to participate and compete for cash prizes.

The first championship was launched with Sophgo as the first sponsor, co-initiated with the RISC-V China Community and the PLCT Lab of the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The second championship was initiated and hosted by Kubuds Technology, with sponsorship from Sophgo and XuanTie.

For more detailed information and updates, you can visit [the official website of the RISC-V Software Porting and Optimization Championship](https://rvspoc.org), or follow the 「**苦芽科技**」 WeChat Official Account.

Starting from the second term, the RISC-V Software Porting and Optimization Championship [has officially joined the Jiachen Project](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ExZG0Vt8RtOCUYQe1JqgKw).
